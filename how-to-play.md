# How to Play Astromania: The Astronomy Card Game
![image](./images/logo.png)
## About This Project
We wanted to make some trading cards to highlight contributions of queer astronomers. But if you already have a deck of fancy cards, why not make a whole game out of it? Astromania is the card game equivalent of real life astronomy research. With its assortment of object cards and tool cards, Astromania lets you strategize and combine techniques to solve the mysteries of the universe - just like a real astrophysicist! Our team is composed of graduate students who are all working towards a PhD in astronomy and are actively involved in ongoing astronomy research.

Astronomy isn’t always just taking pictures of black holes and distant galaxies. It’s a field composed of many people using different methods to study the past, present, and future of our universe. Sometimes we need to craft simulations to test our theories. Sometimes we need to write some code to calculate important statistics. Sometimes we’re caught up in the political machine that is academia. It’s not always pretty and an important part of success is luck. Things don’t always work the way you expect and so we hope we convey the research process in an accurate manner in our game.
## In the Box
### Cards
Draw deck (100 cards):
- 35  Astronomer Cards
- 35 Tool Cards
- 30 Interact Cards

Prompt deck (40 cards)
- 10 Easy Prompt Cards
- 10 Medium Prompt Cards
- 10 Hard Prompt Cards
- 10 Extreme Prompt Cards

Sky deck (60 cards)
- 30 Common Object Cards
- 15 Uncommon Object Cards
- 10 Rare Object Cards
- 5 Legendary Object Cards

### Dice
We include two fair 6 sided dice to be used for our game.

### VP Trackers
We include trackers to keep track of a player’s earned victory points (VP). There are markers to represent 1,5, and 10 VP.
- 24 x (1 VP) markers
- 24 x (5 VP) markers
- 24 x (10 VP) markers

### Evolution Trackers
We include 24 trackers to keep track of the evolution progress of the objects on the Starboard.

## Setup
Optional: Remove the interact cards from the draw deck for solo play.
1. Shuffle the Draw deck (Players hands consist of Tool and Astronomer Cards) and sky deck.
2. Each player draws 5 cards from the draw deck as their starting hand.
3. Place 8 object cards from the sky deck on the Starboard.
4. Roll the 20 sided die to determine who goes first. Turn order proceeds counter-clockwise from the first player.

## Game Layout
An example game can be seen below. All players must be able to see the current prompt, every card on the Starboard, and any cards played on all players' fields.

### Decks
In this game, there are three types of cards, each separated into their own decks. The decks can be distinguished by the color of the card backs. The Draw Deck (red) are the cards that players will draw from to add cards to their hands. The Sky Deck (blue) are where object cards for the Starboard are drawn from. The Prompt Deck (purple) holds all the potential prompts for the game. Each round, a new prompt is drawn from the deck and players must attempt to answer the prompt by accruing enough VP.

## Gameplay
### Turn Actions
On their turn, a player can take up to 3 of any of the following actions:
1. Draw a card from the draw deck
2. Play an astronomer or tool card on your field
3. Use an Astronomer card and a Tool card in your field to attempt to study an object on the Starboard
4. Perform an action listed on a card in your field
5. Use an Interact action card from your hand
6. Discard a card in your hand or field and gain +1VP

### Studying an Object
Choose one object on the Starboard to study. Select one Astronomer and one Tool (both in your field) to study the object with. Roll the dice and sum the resulting values to determine the science power for that analysis. Remember to apply any relevant bonuses!

| Rarity     | Required SP |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Common     | 5     |
| Uncommon   | 7       |
| Rare    | 9     |
| Legendary   | 11       |

If you pair the correct astronomer and tool classes, you gain +1 SP for your attempt at studying (see table below).

| Astronomer Class  | Matching Tool Class |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Observer    | Telescope     |
| Theorist   | Code       |
| Instrumentation | Instrument |
| Multiclass | Any non-Instrument|
| Outreach   | N/A       |


- If your science power is *greater than or equal to* the SP required to observe the object (based on its rarity; see table below), you gain the intrinsic VP of the object and any bonus VP from using your actions plus any VP granted by the object card (use the VP markers to count VP). If the object you observe is a class relevant to the prompt, you gain an additional +4 VP. Move that object to the object discard pile. Then draw a new object card and place it on the Starboard.

- If your final science power is less than the SP required to observe the object, the object remains on the board and you do not gain any VP.

Once an astronomer and/or tool is used to study an object successfully, they may not be used to study a different object in the same turn. To keep track of this, we suggest flipping over cards on your field that can no longer be used in a turn.


### Evolution
Some object cards can evolve if they spend long enough time on the Starboard. After the last player in the turn order has completed their turn and before the turn order resets, place evolution trackers in the evolution tracker slots for the relevant cards. When all of the evolution tracker slots are filled for an object card, immediately search the object deck for the evolved object. Discard the pre-evolution object and the evolution trackers. Place the evolved object on the board in its place and shuffle the object card deck. If there is no evolved form in the deck (e.g. they are all already in play on the Starboard), then the object waits to evolve until there is an evolved object card in the sky deck.

### Rules
- **Hand limit:** A player cannot have more than 9 cards in their hand at the end of their turn. If they have greater than 9 cards at the end of their turn, they must discard cards of their choice such that they only have 9 cards. The player does not gain VP for these discards.
- **Field limit:** A player cannot have more than 3 Astronomers and 3 Tools on their field at any given time.
- **Re-shuffling:** When either the draw or sky deck is empty, re-shuffle the cards in the corresponding discard and place it in the deck location.

## How to Win
 **Winning a round:** The first player who gains the VP required for the prompt wins the round. All VP earned during the round is returned to the bank.

The first player to win 3 rounds achieves complete victory!
